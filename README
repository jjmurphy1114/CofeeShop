PURPOSE:
This program is used to analyse the sales reports of a coffee shop for the desired number of months. This is useful
as it shows the revenue generated from each item, and also shows the top 10 earners, allowing the owner of the shop to
get insight into which items are being sold the most, and which items may not be worth selling in the future. Being able
to restrict which months are inputted into the program is also helpful because it will demonstrate which items sell best
at different times of year, allowing the owner to make better choices on which items should be made and sold for a particular
month or season.

The program creates three text files after running:

-Total_sales.txt: Shows each item and the number of times that item was sold

-Profits.txt: Shows each item, the number of times it was sold, the total cost of making that many items, the sales from
that item, and the overall revenue from that item

-Top_earnrs.txt: Shows the top 10 revenue generating items and the number of times they were sold

INSTRUCTIONS:
To compile simply type "make all" in the terminal.
To run type "./analysis"
