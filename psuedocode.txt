    Declare tally counter variable
    Declare floats cost, sales and Revenue
    Declare float array for revenue and int array for tally of each item
    Declare float max_val and max_row
    Initialize both arrays listed above to 0 at every index

    - Set sales equal to tally times the items buying price (in money array)
    - Set cost equal to the tally times manufacturing price (in money array)
    - Set revenue equal to sales - cost
    - Store tally and revenue into their respective arrays 
    Run a while loop while count is less than 10
    - Set max_val to 0.00 each loop
    Iterate through each row of the revenue array
    - If revenue is greater than the max, set max to that revenue and store the column of that item
    - Print the item number, tally, and revenue of the max item
    - Set that item's revenue to 0
    - Increment count
